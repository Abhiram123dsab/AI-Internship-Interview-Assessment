# Multi-Language Patient Communication System - Assessment Notes

## Project Overview
Developed an intelligent patient communication system for Apollo Clinic in Chennai, featuring advanced ML-based engagement prediction and multi-language support to optimize patient communication effectiveness.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced ML Engagement Prediction
- Implemented deep learning model with residual connections for improved accuracy
- Advanced feature engineering including:
  - Historical engagement patterns
  - Demographic scoring
  - Channel success rate analysis
  - Time-based interaction patterns
- Comprehensive metrics tracking:
  - AUC (Area Under Curve)
  - Precision and Recall
  - Binary Cross-entropy Loss
- Early stopping and model checkpointing for optimal performance

### 2. Multi-Channel Communication Strategy
- Intelligent channel selection based on engagement scores:
  - WhatsApp: High engagement (>0.8)
  - SMS: Moderate engagement (0.4-0.8)
  - IVR: Low engagement (<0.4)
- Channel-specific success rate analysis:
  - WhatsApp: 90% effectiveness
  - SMS: 80% effectiveness
  - IVR: 70% effectiveness
- Personalized timing optimization using historical response patterns

### 3. AI-Enhanced Language Support
- Comprehensive language support with engagement scoring:
  - Tamil (45% of patients)
  - Telugu (20%)
  - Malayalam (15%)
  - Hindi (10%)
  - English (10%)
- Language-specific engagement metrics:
  - Response rates by language
  - Message comprehension tracking
  - Cultural context adaptation

### 4. Advanced Analytics and Monitoring

#### Enhanced Engagement Metrics
- Sophisticated scoring system incorporating:
  - Response rate (30% weight)
